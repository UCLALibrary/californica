# Contributing to FITS

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

The following is a set of guidelines for both contributing to the FITS project and what to do if you find bugs.

#### **Open source license**

By posting a pull request on the FITS GitHub site, you agree that you own the copyright for your software and that the pull request is made freely available and licensed by FITS users for use under the [Apache 2.0 Open Source License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) - the same license by which FITS core code is made available as open source.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/harvard-lts/fits/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/harvard-lts/fits/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, code format, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of FITS will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [FITS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fits-users) and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
* Be sure to include documentation within the code and a clear explanation of the feature or change in your pull request.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use FITS in the [FITS mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fits-users).


Thanks!
