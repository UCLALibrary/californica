He remembers the sound of the airplanes from his neighborhood because he lived next to Mosul Airport. He lived in a large house with three gardens. Abdullah is from a family of five and is not married. His attended primary school at Abey Tamam near the Airport, and secondary school near Nabi Younis mosque on the left bank, so he had to cross the river on the way to school. In school, his teachers were of different ethnicities and sects. His favorite memory of school is when they organized a gallery and the governor of Mosul came to their school to see it. He spent his childhood playing with his friends, usually biking near the river. His favorite game is basketball, and he and his friends collected money to buy a ball. He visited monasteries like Dayr Mar Matti, where they took their food and had a picnic. His uncle's wife was Christian and she lit a candle at the monastery. Abdullah enjoyed Mosul because it is a multicultural city. “All of the components of Iraq were gathered in Mosul,” he says. 1 video (0:50:47)","Mosul Lives Interview of Abdullah Muhammad, March 20, 2017",auis_ml_00001,2017-03-20,,,,,,,,auis_ml_00001.mp4,"https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/ark%3A%2F21191%2Fnoark_auis_ml_00001/manifest"
